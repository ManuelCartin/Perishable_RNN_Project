#Project: Neural Network for Perishable Product Inventory Management

This project was conceived as part of a university course on **Project Methodology and Development**, with the goal of transforming a theoretical proposal into a functional prototype. The initiative seeks to apply **generative AI, data science, and data engineering** techniques to create an intelligent system that helps reduce losses due to product expiration in retail inventories.

---

## General Objective

Develop a system based on **neural networks** that can predict the risk of expiration of perishable products, generating automatic alerts that will be notified to inventory personnel through a future mobile application.

---

## Current Project Status

ðŸ”¹ **Phase 1: Synthetic data generation and validation**
ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Neural network model development
ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Training and evaluation with different scenarios
ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Integration with backend/mobile app (future)

## Test Dataset

Two versions of the synthetic dataset have currently been generated, using a combination of tools such as **GitHub Copilot** and **Mostly AI**:

- **1,120 samples**: for structural validation and stress testing.
- **6,120 samples**: for preliminary model training and simulation of more realistic scenarios.

The variables range from basic data (brand, product, category, expiration date) to operating conditions (current stock, on sale, expiration risk, storage temperature, etc.).

In addition, the dataset allows us to evaluate whether the neural network is sensitive to minor variations, such as changes in supplier, brand, or storage conditions.

## Tools Used

- **Python + Jupyter Notebooks**
- **GitHub Copilot**: semi-structured dataset generation
- **Mostly AI**: synthetic dataset generation with credible dataset extension
- **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib**: exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- (Coming soon) **TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch**: for the neural network model

## Next Steps

- Complete key certifications:
- IBM AI Engineer
- AI Development Engineer
- Building the neural network model
- Supervised training and validation
- Implementing the mobile alert system (future phase)

## Final Notes

This project is under development and its main objective is to **demonstrate the technical and strategic feasibility** of applying generative AI and predictive models in real-life logistics contexts. Although the dataset is synthetic, it is built with real business logic and constraints.
