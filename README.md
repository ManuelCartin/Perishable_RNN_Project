# "SmartStock AI" Project: Leading the Creation of an Inventory Management Solution
This project demonstrates my approach to leading the lifecycle of an AI product from its inception. Its goal is to combat waste in retail inventories through a predictive system that alerts staff to the risk of expiration.

*My role in this project was that of a Hybrid Product Manager, leading the ideation process, concept validation with synthetic data, and the technical roadmap for development.* 

## Phase 1: Data Validation and Strategy
In the first phase, the main challenge was not technological, but strategic: how can we validate the idea with stakeholders without having access to real inventory data?

Key Decision: Rather than delaying the project, I decided to create synthetic datasets with business logic. This allowed us to simulate scenarios, test the concept of the alert system, and demonstrate the project's viability to stakeholders quickly and efficiently.

Methodology: I used tools like GitHub Copilot and Mostly AI to generate two versions of the data: a small one for stress testing and a larger one for training. This iterative approach allowed me to manage risk and validate the solution's structure.

The Synthetic Data Product
The dataset created is a product in itself, designed to facilitate communication and development. It includes key variables such as expiration date, expiration risk, and storage conditions, allowing any team to explore the solution's potential.

## Product Roadmap
This project follows a clear roadmap, focused on delivering incremental value.

Discovery Phase: Creation and validation of the synthetic dataset (Complete).

Development Phase: Creation of the predictive model with neural networks.

Testing Phase: Training and evaluation with realistic scenarios.

Deployment Phase (future): Integration with a mobile app to generate real-time alerts.

## Lessons Learned as a PM
Prioritize validation: It's not necessary to have all the real data to get started. A PM with data engineering skills can create an MVP with synthetic data to validate the business hypothesis.

Strategic communication: Synthetic datasets became a communication tool with stakeholders, allowing us to demonstrate the value of the solution before the model was ready.

Product vision: The project wasn't just about building a neural network, but about solving a real problem for a user (the inventory staff). The entire process was focused on creating a usable and valuable solution.

## Strategic Roadmap: My Path to an AI Product Manager Role
This project, beyond being a demonstration of technical skills, represents my philosophy as a future AI Product Manager. My focus is on leading AI products not only with technical knowledge but also with a clear business vision. The following steps are a demonstration of my commitment to this path.

- Phase 1: Concept Validation (Completed)
Goal: Demonstrate the project's viability with a functional MVP.

Key Actions:

Create the synthetic dataset for stakeholder validation.

Develop a prototype for the proof of concept.

- Phase 2: Strengthen Technical Leadership (In Progress)
This phase focuses on deepening my technical foundation to make more informed decisions and communicate effectively with engineering teams.

Goal: Master the AI ​​model development lifecycle and solution architecture.

Key Actions:

Complete key IBM AI Engineer and IBM AI Development Engineer certifications. This will allow me to understand the technical complexity and limitations of AI systems.

Build the neural network model and validate it, which will serve as a case study to understand the challenges and opportunities in the product development phase.

- Phase 3: Product Vision and Deployment (Coming Soon)
Once the technical foundation is solid, my focus will shift to the business aspects and user experience.

Goal: Understand AI product management from a business perspective.

Key Actions:

Complete the IBM AI Product Manager Professional Certificate to learn about market strategy, feature definition, and stakeholder management.

Plan the deployment of the mobile alert system as the last mile of the product, ensuring that the technical solution translates into real, tangible value for the end user.
